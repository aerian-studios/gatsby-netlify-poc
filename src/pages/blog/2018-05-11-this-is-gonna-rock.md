So let's talk about coffee. On the one hand it is a fragile little lamb that
reacts badly to the wrong environment, the wrong treatement and it breaks. On
the other hand one gets a delicious drink, full of character and... er...
caffeine.

I'm concerned only with enjoying coffee, not with the snootiness that surrounds
coffee making, but there is no denying, if you take a little more care, you get
a lot more for your time.
